Welcome to my project portfolio/blog! Here, you'll find a collection of hands-on projects that showcase my passion for cybersecurity, web development, and system administration. This portfolio includes a range of Capture The Flag (CTF) challenge write ups and Security Operations Center (SOC) lab exercises, and more where I've applied my technical skills to solve real-world security problems.
