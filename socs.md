In my SOC lab exercises, I've built and configured environments that simulate real-world security operations. These labs are designed to test and improve my skills in threat detection, incident response, and security monitoring. By leveraging tools like Splunk, Sysmon, and various attack simulation frameworks, I've created comprehensive scenarios that replicate the challenges faced by security professionals in a SOC environment.
