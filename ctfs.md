CTF challenges are cybersecurity competitions that require participants to solve a variety of tasks related to cryptography, reverse engineering, binary exploitation, web vulnerabilities, and more. These projects demonstrate my ability to think critically and solve complex security issues in a competitive environment. Each CTF project includes a detailed breakdown of the challenge, my approach to solving it, and the lessons learned.
