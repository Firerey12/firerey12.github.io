## Problem

![description](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ecd53c61-6c9d-488b-895b-dac03c5fcd9f)

We were given an image file for this challenge. I decided to open it in FTK Imager, which prompted for a password which we did not have. So I decided to look at the description which just says investigate the clues. Looking at the title it looked creative saying Do[ro x2] which I thought could mean Do and then ro two times leading to Dororo. I thought that might be the password and sure enough it was.

The flag itself wasnâ€™t hard to find since there was only one file in the image which contained the flag

```bash
BattleCTF{You_d0_1t_like_4_pro_forensicator6578888}
```
